      <description>Every data project starts with a broad overview of the information at hand and formation of research questions or business objectives. In this case the questions are conveniently provided. Below is a simple overview of the research questions and provided data sets.
library(data.table) library(ggplot2) for (i in list.files(&amp;quot;/home/kent/Documents/oushowcase/content/data&amp;quot;)) { if (!grepl(&amp;quot;.csv&amp;quot;, i)) return() nm = gsub(&amp;quot;.csv&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, i) assign(nm, fread(paste0(&amp;quot;/home/kent/Documents/oushowcase/content/data/&amp;quot;,i)) |&amp;gt; janitor::clean_names() ) } Research Questions The state has launched the ‘Smart Start’ Program and the university is being asked to review entry level courses.</description>

      <description>What are our overall success rates? (C or better). To determine this simple ratio, we first need to factor success in accordance with the course_enrollments data set which includes official grades.
source(&amp;quot;~/Documents/oushowcase/content/scripts/clean.R&amp;quot;) copy(raw_data$course_enrollments)[ # spare the typing and use regex to find successful scores ,success := grepl(&amp;quot;A|B|C(?!\\-)&amp;quot;, official_grade, perl = T) &amp;amp; completed_flag == 1 &amp;amp; official_grade != &amp;quot;NC&amp;quot; # the one that got away ][,.N, success ][,percent := N/sum(N) ][] |&amp;gt; {\(x) { assign(&amp;quot;success_rate&amp;quot;, x[(success)]$percent, envir = .</description>

      <title>What student information helps predict success in their courses?</title>

      <description>Defining the Problem This research question builds on our prior understanding of the term success being a C or better grade. We want to seek out variables that can predict official grades of a C or above. We also know that we want to work within the confines of student information. Because we know we’ll need the course_enrollments data, we can reference the data keys and columns to see what relational databases have student information which we can connect to successful outcomes.</description>
