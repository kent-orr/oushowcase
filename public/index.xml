      <description>We’ve looked at a few facets of predicting student success. This post will combine what we have learned so far and bring in new imputed variables to help predict the success of a student.
To explore, I want to bring together as many pieces of data as possible. I’ll be linking the course_enrollments, student_details, and acad_plan data sets
concat &amp;lt;- course_enrollments[,merge(.SD, student_details, all.x = T, by = nm_intersect(course_enrollments, student_details))] |&amp;gt; merge(x = _, acad_plan, by.</description>

      <description>Defining the Problem Do some instructors have significantly higher success rates among the students in their courses than others? We will merge the course_enrollments with class_instructors. From there we will determine success ratios per instructor and compare.
is &amp;lt;- merge(course_enrollments[,.(term_code, class_nbr, student_id_number, official_grade, success)], class_instructors, on = c(&amp;quot;term_code&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;class_nbr&amp;quot;)) iss &amp;lt;- is[,.N, .(instructor_id_number, term_code, class_nbr, success) ][,percent := N/sum(N), .(instructor_id_number, term_code, class_nbr) ][] iss[(success)] |&amp;gt; ggplot(aes(x = reorder(as.factor(instructor_id_number), percent), y = percent)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_bw() + theme(axis.</description>

      <description>Defining the Problem Over time term_code, are success rates improving or not? Since we’re working with frequencies and ratios we can use a Chi-squares to determine if there is any change between success rates and terms.
copy(course_enrollments)[,.N,.(term_code, success)][,percent := N/sum(N), term_code] |&amp;gt; ggplot(aes(x = term_code, y = percent, fill = success)) + geom_col() + theme_classic() + scale_fill_viridis_d() copy(course_enrollments)[,.(term_code, success)] |&amp;gt; table() |&amp;gt; chisq.test() ## ## Pearson&amp;#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: table(copy(course_enrollments)[, .</description>

      <description>Defining the Problem We have already established that some instructors perform better than others. Now we want to answer if the number of term_id’s an instructor_id_number is associated with a class_nbr is related to student success rates. I will use the same merge of course_enrollments and class_instructors used to detect variation in instructor performance rates, as well as class_inventory to derive the number of similar courses each instructor has taught by subject and catalog number.</description>

      <description>Every data project starts with a broad overview of the information at hand and formation of research questions or business objectives. In this case the questions are conveniently provided. Below is a simple overview of the research questions and provided data sets.
library(data.table) library(ggplot2) for (i in list.files(&amp;quot;/home/kent/Documents/oushowcase/content/data&amp;quot;)) { if (!grepl(&amp;quot;.csv&amp;quot;, i)) return() nm = gsub(&amp;quot;.csv&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, i) assign(nm, fread(paste0(&amp;quot;/home/kent/Documents/oushowcase/content/data/&amp;quot;,i)) |&amp;gt; janitor::clean_names() ) } Research Questions The state has launched the ‘Smart Start’ Program and the university is being asked to review entry level courses.</description>

      <description>What are our overall success rates? (C or better). To determine this simple ratio, we first need to factor success in accordance with the course_enrollments data set which includes official grades.
source(&amp;quot;~/Documents/oushowcase/content/scripts/clean.R&amp;quot;) copy(raw_data$course_enrollments)[ # spare the typing and use regex to find successful scores ,success := grepl(&amp;quot;A|B|C(?!\\-)&amp;quot;, official_grade, perl = T) &amp;amp; completed_flag == 1 &amp;amp; official_grade != &amp;quot;NC&amp;quot; # the one that got away ][,.N, success ][,percent := N/sum(N) ][] |&amp;gt; {\(x) { assign(&amp;quot;success_rate&amp;quot;, x[(success)]$percent, envir = .</description>

      <title>What student information helps predict success in their courses?</title>

      <description>Defining the Problem This research question builds on our prior understanding of the term success being a C or better grade. We want to seek out variables that can predict official grades of a C or above. We also know that we want to work within the confines of student information. Because we know we’ll need the course_enrollments data, we can reference the data keys and columns to see what relational databases have student information which we can connect to successful outcomes.</description>
