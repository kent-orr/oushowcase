What are our overall success rates? (C or better). To determine this simple ratio, we first need to factor success in accordance with the `course_enrollments` data set which includes official grades. 

```{r setup}
source("~/Documents/oushowcase/content/scripts/clean.R")

copy(raw_data$course_enrollments)[ 
  # spare the typing and use regex to find successful scores
  ,success := grepl("A|B|C(?!\\-)", official_grade, perl = T) & 
    completed_flag == 1 & official_grade != "NC" # the one that got away
  ][,.N, success
    ][,percent := N/sum(N)
      ][] |>
  {\(x) {
    assign("success_rate", x[(success)]$percent,
           envir = .GlobalEnv)
    return(x)
  }}() |>
  kableExtra::kable(format.args = list(big.mark = ",", digits = 2)) |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

# There is a **`r scales::percent(success_rate, accuracy = 1)`** overall student success rate.
